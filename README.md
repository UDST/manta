# traffic-simulator-extended
Traffic Microsimulator with Extensions

## Dependencies

 - Boost 1.59
 - OpenCV (used versions: 2.4.12 in Windows; 3.2.0 in Ubuntu)
 - CUDA (used versions: 8.0.61 in Windows; 9.0 in Ubuntu)
 - g++ (used verions: 6.4.0 in Ubuntu)
 - Qt5 (used verions: 5.9.5 in Ubuntu)
 - qmake (used verions: 3.1 in Ubuntu)

## Installation & Compilation

Once the necessaries dependencies are installed you can use the following lines to make sure the
correct verions of each one are used:
```bash
export PATH=PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin:$PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64:$LIBRARY_PATH 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
```

In Linux you can also add those `export`statements lines at the end of your user's `~/.bashrc` to
avoid re-entering them on each session.

Clone in your home directory with:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ual/traffic-simulator-extended.git ~/traffic-simulator-extended && cd ~/traffic-simulator-extended
```

If necessary checkout a different branch than master (`maintenance` for instance):
```bash
git checkout maintenance
```

Create `Makefile` and compile with:
```bash
sudo qmake LivingCity/LivingCity.pro && sudo make -j
```

## Running

If you wish to edit configuration, modify `command_line_options.ini`.

Run with:
```bash
cd LivingCity
./LivingCity
```

## Functions called when running
1) Once ./LivingCity is invoked without the GUI, LC_main() is called. 
2) Within LC_main(), runB18Simulation() is called, which begins the traffic microsimulation.
	- runB18Simulation(), located in traffic/b18CommandLineVersion.cpp.
		- loadB2018RoadGraph() loads the street network (now made from network_and_bpr_creation.ipynb) and the OD demand (now made from taz_to_nodes.ipynb). Specifically, it loads from the csv files that contain the full bay area street network (nodes.csv), the edges (edges.csv), and the origin destination pairs (od_demand.csv). Each file is then parsed to create a network based on lat-long.
		- initSimulator() initializes the newly loaded street network and OD pairs.
		- createB2018People() generates a synthetic population with certain attributes. Specifically, it calls resetTrafficPersonJob() and loadB18TrafficPeople().
			- resetTrafficPersonJob() makes every active person in the synthetic population to be 0 (resets each person).
			- loadB18TrafficPeople() creates a random seed from boost using normal_distribution() with mean 7.5 and variance .75. Then, using that random seed, it calls randomPerson().
				- randomPerson() takes as arguments the index of the person, the person pointer, the origin lat/long, destination lat/long, and start time. It then sets the person's acceleration, braking, time headway, the number of steps, the number of lanes in the edge, and the state of its lane changes. This is then called by an overarching randomPerson() function that finds the closest nodes to the person based on their house position and job position. All of these persons are now in a persons vector (trafficPersonVec)
		- simulateInCPU_MultiPass() if using CPU or simulateInGPU() if using GPU (we do use the GPU)
			- createLaneMap() is called, which creates the data for each edge, checking the distribution of the edge lengths and widths. Now every attribute about the edge is stored in the edgesData vector. It also creates an intersection vector, which contains the state of the intersection, the number of in/out edges of the intersection, and what the next 'event' is, the edge angle from the vertex itself, and the exact edges to/from that intersection.
			- generateRoutes() does traffic assignment using Johnson's shortest path algorithm. This takes in the road graph, the trafficPersonVec, indexPathVec (the indices of each edge that is traversed by a person), lane map mapping, weight, and peoplePathSampling.
			- generateRoutesMulti() uses Dijkstra's priority queue algorithm, where it creates a counter to keep track of where to put more edges and updates the weight edges using the average speed of the edge sampled from a former step. 
				- calculateSeveralPeopleRoute() sees whether the person is at their destination; if not, it uses Dijkstra to figure out each person's path to their destination.
			- simulateInCPU()
				- simulateOneIntersectionCPU() takes the current time, the intersections vector pointer, and the traffic lights pointer. It first checks if the current time is after the next event for the intersection and if the intersection has real edges. If so, it writes the old traffic lights to 0 in memory. Then, it loops through the intersection's edges and changes the state of the intersection to the next light. Then, it sets that edge's characteristics (such as numLines), and then it sets the traffic light to green. Finally, it sets the intersection's nextEvent to the current time plus the delta in time to the next event.
				- simulateOnePersonCPU() takes the delta time, current time, map for read and write shifting, trafficPersonVec, indexPathVec, edgesData, laneMap, intersections, and trafficlights. It first checks if the person should wait (if time_departure > currentTime) or start (time_departure < currentTime). If the latter, it then finds the first edge and then updates that person's edge data (i.e. creates the trafficPersonVec with the specific edges for that particular person's route). It then creates the lane map for that person's first edge, determining the exact lanes the person will pass on that edge (it does this by first counting all the empty cells on the edge to see if there is space for the car). Then, it checks whether the car is ready for the next edge, so it will change it so that it is in the intersection. Now the person/car starts moving, trying to go from the current edge to the next edge. To do so, first it finds the car in front of it in the same lane. Once the car reaches the traffic light, it sees if the car is allowed to move before and at the intersection. Then, it moves into the new edge after the traffic light by updating the current edge and the lane in the edge. Now that it's in the new lane, it starts checking for the speed of the car in front. If it's slower than us, it makes a discretionary lane change. In this entire process, it is also calculating emissions and gas consumption. If the route requires a mandatory lane change, it checks to see if there are any open cells and the speeds of the adjacent cars, and then waits x amount of time to make the lane change (this is part of calculateGapsLC().) This process repeats for each person and along the full route for each person.
				- sampleTraffic() counts the number of people in the trafficPersonVec, then it loops through the number of people. If each person's trafficPersonVec is active, it updates the accSpeedPerLinePerTimeInterval for each person's car with "offset" as the increment, which is the numLines * samplingNumber.

Overall, when the simulator is called, it first loads a street network from file, which has edges and nodes. After this, the actual simulator is run. Since the goal is to simulate a synthetic population's movement in traffic, the simulator first creates a synthetic population, where each person is an element in the vector trafficPersonVec. It creates this population randomly, and it determines each person's origin and destination, their start time, and then also microscopic details like their accelerations, number of lane changes, etc.

Once we have this information about each person, it determines the shortest path for each OD pair using either Johnson's or Djikstra's shortest path algorithm. This shortest path algorithm is run only in the CPU. Currently, Johnson's is much faster than Dijkstra's, but it still must be improved if we want to run it on larger networks. Ideally, we want to re-run the shortest path whenever the graph weights change, but we need to determine empirically at what number of graph weights change does the accuracy of the simulator plateau (or how poor the accuracy is without a graph weights change.) Paul is saying a first guess would be to update these once per simulated hour or half hour during low congestion periods, and once per 10 to 15 minutes in more congested periods.

Once the edges are known, it begins the simulation of real-time movement. The simulation can be done in either the GPU or the CPU; however, the GPU is typically preferred due to its parallelization. In this real-time simulation, it will create a lanemap of each edge that shows which cells are taken and which ones are empty. Based on this and discretionary/mandatory lane changing logic, the person's position will move, given that we know what its next edge needs to be. Then, it will reach an intersection (node), where there is a traffic light (or some level of traffic control). Based on this traffic control, it determines whether it can move at the intersection (based again on cells being populated as a proxy for traffic.) If it notices it can move onto the new edge, the new edge now becomes the current edge. Thus, each car, at each time step, must compute its new speed, acceleration, and position. For speed and acceleration, the car checks teh traffic atlas above (reading contiguous bytes from its current position) to find the position and speed of the surrounding cars. Once that is known, per-vehicle behavior based on car-following, lane-changing, and gap-acceptance can be applied. These dynamics will then determine the car's position, as it might stay in the current edge (it hasn't reached the end of the edge) or it might move to the next edge in its route. NOTE: If we are able to decrease the time spent doing shortest path, then this simulation step becomes the bottleneck. 

This is run in a loop across all trafficPersonVecs (people) and dynamically changes according to various person positions.
