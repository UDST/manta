Microsimulation Analysis for Network Traffic Assignment. MANTA employs a highly parallelized GPU implementation that is fast enough to run simulations on large-scale demand and networks within a few minutes - metropolitan and regional scale with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges and millions of trips. We test our platform to simulate the entire Bay Area metropolitan region over the course of the morning using half-second time steps. The runtime for the nine-county Bay Area simulation is just over four minutes, not including routing and initialization. This computational performance significantly improves state of the art in large-scale traffic microsimulation and offers new capacity for analyzing the detailed travel patterns and travel choices of individuals for infrastructure planning and emergency management.

## Dependencies

 - Boost 1.59
 - OpenCV (used versions: 3.2.0 in Ubuntu)
 - CUDA (used versions: 9.0 in Ubuntu)
 - g++ (used versions: 6.4.0 in Ubuntu)
 - Qt5 (used versions: 5.9.5 in Ubuntu)
 - qmake (used verions: 3.1 in Ubuntu)

## Installation & Compilation

Once the necessary dependencies are installed, you can use the following lines to make sure the
correct versions of each one are used:
```bash
export PATH=PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin:$PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64:$LIBRARY_PATH 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/USER_NAME/pandana/src
```

You can also add the `export` lines at the end of your user's `~/.bashrc` to
avoid re-entering them in each session.

Clone the repo in your home directory with:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:udst/manta.git ~/manta && cd ~/manta
```

If necessary, you can checkout a different branch than master (`edge_speeds_over_time` for instance):
```bash
git checkout edge_speeds_over_time
```

Create `Makefile` and compile with:
```bash
sudo qmake LivingCity/LivingCity.pro && sudo make -j
```

## Running

If you wish to edit the microsimulation configuration, modify `command_line_options.ini`.

Run with:
```bash
cd LivingCity
./LivingCity
```
In `command_line_options.ini`, you can modify the timestep (default dt = .5 seconds), simulation time range (default 5am-12pm), specific path to the network and OD demand, whether you would like to compute the shortest paths or use a previous version, and which type of routing.
