""" This file contains system tests that consider LivingCity as a black box,
    where inputs are given and outputs are validated.
    
    Tests are divided in Shallow and Deep tests. Shallow tests are fast (a couple of minutes at most),
    while deep tests are more exhaustive and take longer. Shallow tests are executed for all simulated
    people while deep tests are executed for a small set of people given by `test_setup.deep_testing_people`.

    Pytest ensures that each test runs automatically for all Setups given by the global variable `pytest.test_setups`.
    In addition, it ensures its simulation runs before each test, if it was not run before.
    This allows the user to run a specific test, i.e.
    `pytest -x -s tests/outputFilesTestSuite.py::test06_last_edge_of_trip_should_go_to_end_intersection`

    In the context of each test, the variable `test_setup` has all input and output variables regarding its setup.
    Therefore, no additional reading from the disk is necessary, since all output files are already loaded in memory.
    Since these variables are shared between tests, they should not be modified in the scope of the tests, only read.
